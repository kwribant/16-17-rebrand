    overview: [
        "I started at Dropbox in October 2014 as one of two website-focused front end engineers. At the time, the Dropbox Business site supported one width and lacked a scalable site architecture. Our main sources of revenue were minor modifications to the homepage and new SEO landing pages. My first projects involved creating new sections of the site, including the Trust suite.",
        "What started out as a variant-based layout experiment on the homepage became an entire redesign of Dropbox Business. Color and typography were standardized, the design featured a new visual concept, and a responsive layout was considered for the first time."
    ],
    reflections: [
        "This was the first large project our team (of four, at the time) took on. At first, I was the sole developer working on this redesign. I didn’t realize the complexity of the project and as the deadline steadily approached, the rest of the team joined in and pushed it past the finish line.",
        "This project taught me that actively prioritizing your work, constantly communicating with your team and providing brutally honest time estimates are necessary to produce something you’re proud of."
